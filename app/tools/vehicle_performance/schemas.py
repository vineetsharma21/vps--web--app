    Input schema for locomotive performance analysis in railway operations.

    This model validates user inputs for comprehensive locomotive performance
    evaluation including tractive effort, speed capabilities, gear optimization,
    and performance characteristics across different operating conditions.

        slope_unit (str): Units for slope specification (default: "%")
                         - "%": Slope as percentage (rise/run × 100)
                         - "degree": Slope angle in degrees

    Validation Rules:
    - Physical parameters (weights, speeds, power) must be positive
    - Integer parameters (axles, RPM) must be positive
    - Friction coefficient must be between 0 and 1
    - At least one gear ratio required, all ratios must be positive
    - Curve and slope units must be valid options

    Engineering Considerations:
    - Gear ratios should be ordered from highest to lowest numerically
    - Torque curve should cover the full RPM range for accurate interpolation
    - Friction coefficient varies with rail conditions (wet/dry, clean/dirty)
    - Maximum curve/slope define the locomotive's operational envelope

    Example:
        >>> input_data = VehiclePerformanceInput(
        ...     max_curve=6.0,           # 6 degree maximum curve
        ...     max_slope=2.0,           # 2% maximum gradient
        ...     loco_gvw=120000,         # 120 tonne locomotive
        ...     max_speed=100,           # 100 km/h max speed
        ...     num_axles=4,             # 4 powered axles
        ...     rear_axle_ratio=3.5,     # 3.5:1 axle ratio
        ...     gear_ratios=[8.5, 6.2, 4.5, 3.2, 2.1],  # 5-speed transmission
        ...     shunting_load=2000,      # 2000 tonne shunting capacity
        ...     peak_power=2000,         # 2000 kW peak power
        ...     friction_mu=0.35,        # 0.35 friction coefficient
        ...     wheel_dia=1.25,          # 1.25m wheel diameter
        ...     min_rpm=400,             # 400 RPM idle
        ...     max_rpm=2100,            # 2100 RPM max
        ...     curve_unit="degree",
        ...     slope_unit="%"
        ... )

    Note:
        Input validation ensures physically meaningful locomotive specifications
        and prevents calculation errors that could lead to unsafe or unrealistic
        performance predictions. All parameters should be verified against
        manufacturer specifications for accurate analysis.
