    Calculate gradient (slope) resistance per tonne of train weight.

    Gradient resistance is the additional force required to move a train uphill.

        - Degree: Uses tan(θ) where θ is the angle in degrees
        - 1 in G: Direct ratio (rise/run) - steeper when G is smaller
        - Formula: Resistance = sin(θ) × 1000 kg/tonne (approximated)

    Examples:
        - 1 degree: ~17.4 kg/tonne
        - 1 in 100: 10 kg/tonne
